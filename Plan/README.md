# OK, Here's the Plan...

I had trouble coming up with a project at first because, although I had plenty of ideas, none of them had a *purpose*. Engineering is all about creativly solving problems, but there were no problems that I wanted or needed to solve with my available materials. But then I thought, well, what about making a game? The only purpose of any game is to exist and be enjoyable. But how to make a game? Should it be physical or digital? Is it even possible with a Metro Express? That's where the SSD1306 LCD will come into play. The screen is 128x64 pixels which is big enough to run most retro games with a few tweaks to the sprites.

Then my challenge was deciding which game I wanted to make. It has to be engaging, but feasible to recreate, so, I jotted down some ideas and compared their pros and cons (hopefully you can read the chart - some of the writting is a bit small. Also, apologies for any spelling errors. I'm a terrible speller and Procreate doesn't have spell-check. Neither does Github for that matter).
