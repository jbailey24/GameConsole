# OK, Here's the Plan...

I had trouble coming up with a project at first because, although I had plenty of ideas, none of them had a *purpose*. Engineering is all about creativly solving problems, but there were no problems that I wanted or needed to solve with my available materials. But then I thought, well, what about making a game? The only purpose of any game is to exist and be enjoyable. But how to make a game? Should it be physical or digital? Is it even possible with a Metro Express? That's where the SSD1306 LCD will come into play. The screen is 128x64 pixels which is big enough to run most retro games with a few tweaks to the sprites.

Then my challenge was deciding which game I wanted to make. It has to be engaging, but feasible to recreate, so, I jotted down some ideas and compared their pros and cons (hopefully you can read the chart - some of the writting is a bit small. Also, apologies for any spelling errors. I'm a terrible speller and Procreate doesn't have spell-check. Neither does Github for that matter).

Eventually I got it narrowed down to three games: Phoenix, Dragonfire, and Snake, but I wasn't sure which one was best. The more fun the game the more complex and time consumming to make. The issue is that I'm not sure how much time I have to make this project and more importantly, how long it'll take. I've never done anything like this before and so that aspect is unclear. But don't worry, I've made a plan to combat that uncertainty. When doing any project, especially one involving new tools, it's a good idea to break it into smaller, mini-project chunks to learn the individual components. My plan is to do bunch of these mini-projects, but without a known end point. I'll first try and make a game that just involves the basic components of game design: user input, sprites, collisions, and a scoreboard. Then I can ramp it up to increasingly more complex games. If I make all the games and I still have time, I can make an animated game intro, highscore boards, etc.

There's a very real possiblity that this will turn out to be more complex than I thought and I will only get through one or two games, but that's completely fine with me. I'm purposfully trying to set a higher goal than I will most likely realistically acheive, just in case I do get that far. Once I'm farther into this project, I can take a better estimate on how much I can do and set a definate goal.

So anyways, here's my first game. It's designed to be about as simple as a game can possibly be. I'm calling it TunnelDash for now because my first (very creative and catchy) name, Maze, includes an M which is hard to write with low numbers of pixels.

Here's my second game:

Here's my third. My family has an Atari 2600 and lots of obscure games, this being on of them. It's actully pretty fun.

And finally, Phoenix, my favorite Atari game. It's much more complex then any of the other games due to the flying and shooting patterns of the enemies, so I doubt I'll ever get to finishing it, but I can't not include it as a possibility.

Just to make sure that 128x64 was enough pixels, I made a few mockups and it seems to work great.

I'm planning on the hardware being fairly simple: a box with a LCD, a few buttons, and a potentiometer. I really want to put most of my focus into the software for this project. I also know this is a team project, but I was wondering if I could work by myself. I have a lot of ideas for what I want to do that are very specific and most other people wouldn't be that interested in. It's also very difficult to work collaboratively in a virtual enviornment, and so I feel like I'd actully be more productive by myself. 
</p>
Anyways, that's my plan. My next step would be to get the LCD and learn how to turn the pixels on and off. Perhaps make a library to do that. Does this all seem good to you?
