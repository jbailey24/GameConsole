# OK, Here's the Plan...

I had trouble coming up with a project at first because, although I had plenty of ideas, none of them had a *purpose*. Engineering is all about creativly solving problems, but there were no problems that I wanted or needed to solve with my available materials. But then I thought, well, what about making a game? The only purpose of any game is to exist and be enjoyable. But how to make a game? Should it be physical or digital? Is it even possible with a Metro Express? That's where the SSD1306 LCD will come into play. The screen is 128x64 pixels which is big enough to run most retro games with a few tweaks to the sprites.

Then my challenge was deciding which game I wanted to make. It has to be engaging, but feasible to recreate, so, I jotted down some ideas and compared their pros and cons (hopefully you can read the chart - some of the writting is a bit small. Also, apologies for any spelling errors. I'm a terrible speller and Procreate doesn't have spell-check. Neither does Github for that matter).

Eventually I got it narrowed down to three games: Phoenix, Dragonfire, and Snake, but I wasn't sure which one was best. The more fun the game the more complex and time consumming to make. The issue is that I'm not sure how much time I have to make this project and more importantly, how long it'll take. I've never done anything like this before and so that aspect is unclear. But don't worry, I've made a plan to combat that uncertainty. When doing any project, especially one involving new tools, it's a good idea to break it into smaller, mini-project chunks to learn the individual components. My plan is to do bunch of these mini-projects, but without a known end point. I'll first try and make a game that just involves the basic components of game design: user input, sprites, collisions, and a scoreboard. Then I can ramp it up to increasingly more complex games. If I make all the games and I still have time, I can make an animated game intro, highscore boards, etc.

There's a very real possiblity that this will turn out to be more complex than I thought and I will only get through one or two games, but that's completely fine with me. I'm purposfully trying to set a higher goal than I will most likely realistically acheive, just in case I do get that far. Once I'm farther into this project, I can take a better estimate on how much I can do and set a definate goal.

So anyways, here's my first game.m
