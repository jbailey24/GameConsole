# GameConsole

My goal for this project was to create a fully-functioning, self-made game on a ssd1306 led. Although I fell short of realizing this goal, I made significant progress towards achieving it and was able to overcome numerous obsticles along the way. I enjoyed venturing outside the relm of the projects we did in the first semester, and found it rewarding to solve encountered problems (mostly) on my own. 

My final version of the project loads up a maze onto the ssd1306 along with a square, movable player. The player can be controlled with 4 buttons (left, right, up, down) to navigate through the maze. If the player touches the maze wall, the text 'game over' appears, followed by 'your score: 00000" (the zeros act as placeholders instead of an actual time). Ideally, the game would have scored the time it took to complete the maze, and would have kept track of the fastest time. 

My biggest limiting factor was the storage space on the Metro Express. I constantly had to work around memory errors, and I don't know if I would have been able to complete the game, even when given more time, because of them.
